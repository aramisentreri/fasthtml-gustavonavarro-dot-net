I am a repurposed math PhD, working in Algorithms and software leadership in the Bay Area. In the past I worked mainly in problems related to Fluid dynamics and Free boundary problems. My thesis was on the local and global well-posedness of the Two-Phase Stefan problem, which is a model for the interaction of two phases of a fluid, like ice and water, and the evolution of the interface that separates the two.

I am interested in anything related to mathematics, from numerical simulations of differential equations, to optimization, and lately Data Science. Any problem that can be modeled into a mathematical question, and that requires deep thinking and the development of new mathematical tools sparks my interest.
